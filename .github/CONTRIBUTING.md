### Opening a Pull Request üìù

Opening a Pull Request means you've made or are going to make code/documentation changes to the library.

Please make sure to read these guidelines thorougly; failing to meet some of the rules will mean more work for everyone involved!

**Setting up your enviornment:**

1. [Fork](https://github.com/timothyckl/league.py/fork) the `league.py` respository.
2. Clone your forked repository. `git clone https://github.com/{username}/league.py`
3. Create a new feature branch. `git checkout -b new-feature`

    **NOTE:** Please do **not** commit any changes to the `main` or `dev` branch. Create a new branch with a name that fits the changes you are making.

4. Commit your changes. `git commit -a -m 'Add some feature'`
5. Push to origin. `git push origin new-feature`

**Installing local changes:**

If you want to test your local changes to `league.py`, run `pip install -e .` from the working directory. This ensures that setuptools and the standard installation process runs smoothly. You may have to uninstall previous versions of `league.py`.

**Opening the Request:**

When creating a pull request, please request to merge into the `dev` branch, **not** the `master` branch. 
<!-- The `main` branch is for the latest **stable** version (), so working changes must not be made to that branch. -->
